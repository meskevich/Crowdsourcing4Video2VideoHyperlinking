<p><b>Find interesting things people say in videos</b></p>

<p>Imagine that you are going to share this video on a social network such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. And you can choose a part of this video that the other users can preview while reading your sharing comment. This part of the video, which we call a <b>&quot;segment&quot;</b>, will give them an idea of what the video is about and give them a chance to watch the most interesting part of it.</p>
<!--For the other users this part of the video, or segment, will give an idea  in order to decide for themselves whether it is interesting for them to watch the whole video.  It should be a meaningful part of the video.-->

<p>This segment should be between 10 and 60 seconds long.</p>

<p><b>The segment should be in the middle of speech in the video, not in the beginning (at least 1 minute after the start of the speech).</b></p>

<p>Some videos were segmented beforehand <!--parts that you will watch has been selected from --> within a larger video, so do not be alarmed if the video doesn&#39;t start at the beginning (and also don&#39;t scroll back beyond the beginning of video segment).</p>

<p>When you are finished with answering the questions, don&#39;t forget to click the &quot;Submit&quot; button at the bottom of the page. Thank you very much for your help!</p>

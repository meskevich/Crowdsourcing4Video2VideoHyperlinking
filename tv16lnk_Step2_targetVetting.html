<p><b>Task:&nbsp;</b><b style="line-height: 1.6em;"></b></p>

<p>We have a system that provides people with video segments, when they type in a sentence describing what they are looking for.</p>
<p>In this task, we ask you to read a list of sentences and to pick the sentence that you think is the description that the person originally gave to us.

<p>Please watch the video segment and pick the description. (Note that this video is a segment that is part of a larger video. Please concentrate on what this particular segment is about.)

Note: You might feel your best match is a good or even an excellent match. It is also possible that this question is difficult to answer because none of the choices is a particularly good match. If there is no particular good match, please make a choice the best you can.</span></p>

                <p><input id="OptionNo" name="DecisionAssessment" type="radio" value="2" /><label for="OptionNo"> I felt that the video I chose was the best possible in the list. It wasn't a particularly good match, and for this reason the question was not easy to answer.</label></p>

<p>Please note that in doing this HIT you are taking part in an academic research study. Our review process involves many manual steps. We are also a small team. For this reason, there might be a delay in the approval of your work. We do our best to keep this delay to 2-3 days at the very maximum.</p>

<p>Note: It is important that before you submit the HIT you take one more look at the answer that you provided. We ask you to double check that you have written 2-3 complete sentences and that your grammar is OK. We also ask you to check to make sure that the relationship between your sentences and the video is very clear.</p>
